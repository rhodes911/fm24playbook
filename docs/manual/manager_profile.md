# Managerial Profile & Home

This page explains your in-game manager profile, what affects it, how promises and objectives work, career progression options and how to interact with the media and club personnel.

## Profile

Your manager profile stores identity details and a set of higher-level characteristics that track your managerial style and reputation. These are visible under `My Profile` and evolve based on your decisions and delegation choices.

Key characteristics

- Reputation: How well-known and respected you are. Higher reputation attracts interest from bigger clubs and helps recruitment.
- Media Handling: How you deal with journalists and press conferences. Regular, controlled engagement improves this rating; storming out or delegating poorly can harm it.
- Tactical Consistency: A measure of how often you change core tactics. Sticking to one consistent approach raises this rating.
- Hands-On Approach: Reflects how much you personally manage tasks such as training, scouting and team talks versus delegating to staff.
- Managing Finances: Reflects the club’s financial health and how well you manage the wage budget and transfers.
- Handling Team Discipline: Tracks squad harmony and disciplinary incidents; this value is frozen for the first ninety days at a new job so inherited issues aren’t counted immediately.
- Loyalty to Players: Based on average player tenure under your management; long-serving players increase this score.
- Domestic Player Bias: A measure of how domestically-focused your squad is versus relying on foreign players.

Your profile also records what you are 'Known For' (your managerial tendencies) and summarises your press interaction style and player relationships.

## Promises

Promises are commitments you make to players or the Board (sometimes negotiated into contracts). The Promises panel tracks their status and deadlines.

Consequences of breaking promises

- Initial failures are forgivable and you will usually have opportunities to repair relationships.
- Repeated or serious breaches can damage player morale and your relationship with the Board, possibly leading to transfers away, reduced patience from directors, or dismissal.

## Visions & Objectives

Each job has a long-term vision and season-by-season objectives (often spanning up to five years). Your role is to guide the club toward these targets. Boards may adjust objectives if progress is insufficient, and contract negotiations are your chance to influence the vision and targets.

## Manager Timeline

The Manager Timeline provides a visual history of your career: appointments, trophies, media clippings, notable matches and other highlights. Use it to review progress and navigate to specific seasons or events.

## Career Options

- Coaching courses: Request Board permission to attend coaching courses to improve attributes; you always pass courses yourself but staff may not.
- Interaction & Relationships: Your dealings with players, staff and media build positive or negative relationships which affect negotiation outcomes and press reaction.
- History: A running record of achievements, press conferences and significant conversations.

## Conversations, Media & Gestures

- Private conversations: Speak to individual players from their Interaction tab; be mindful that upsetting them can cause morale issues.
- Team meetings: Call group discussions to address squad-wide topics, especially ahead of key matches.
- Gestures: Non-verbal cues that add emphasis to your messages can enhance or undermine the message depending on context.

## Press Conferences

- Pre/post-match and special-event press conferences are opportunities to shape public perception. Each question shows its source and a recommended tone. You can also type free-text comments.
- Delegation: You can send a backroom staff member to attend on your behalf either per-event or permanently via Staff Responsibilities. Monitor how players and the media respond to your stand-in.
- Storming out: Leaving a press conference abruptly will harm your Media Handling and may have other reputational effects.

## Additional Notes

Interactions are richer in this version of the game. Agents and press are more active; context-specific options make it easier to select precisely what you want to say in a conversation.
