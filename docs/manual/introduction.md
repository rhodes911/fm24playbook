# Introduction

Welcome! These notes summarise what the FM24 Manual sets out to do and how to use it.

## Summary
- The manual helps you get comfortable with each area of the game.
- It aims to answer common questions and smooth over confusing moments.
- It’s written for everyone: new managers and long-time veterans.
- It isn’t a ‘how to win’ guide; it won’t reveal hidden internals. Expect guidance, not exploits.

## What to Expect
- Friendly guidance to understand each module (tactics, training, transfers, matches, etc.).
- Posed questions and answers to address typical issues you’ll face on your path to success.
- Pointers that spark ideas and encourage experimentation.

## What Not to Expect
- No step-by-step meta or guaranteed winning blueprint.
- No deep dive into simulation internals or engine secrets.
- No copy-paste tactics; the goal is literacy, not memorisation.

## How to Use These Notes
- Skim before you jump into a new area of the game; revisit when something feels off.
- Use the links between topics to understand how decisions in one module affect another.
- Pair with our Matchday Playbook to turn understanding into in-game choices.

## Matchday Implications
- Understanding the high-level aims helps you frame in-match decisions: keep talks and shouts purposeful, align mentality to risk appetite, and react to context, not vibes.
- Treat the manual as foundational literacy; our rules engine encodes the tactical nudges so you can act quickly during matches.
