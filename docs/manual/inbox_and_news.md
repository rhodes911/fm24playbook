# Inbox & News

This page explains how the Inbox, News and Social Feed work and how to control the content you receive so it stays relevant to your job as manager.

## The Inbox — your central hub

The Inbox is the game’s primary hub for all items that directly affect you or your club. Match invitations, transfer offers, meeting requests, regulatory deadlines and staff messages all arrive here as news items.

Priority and required responses

- Important items are highlighted and labelled as `Must Respond`; when one of these appears the game will pause and require you to act before continuing.
- `Must Respond` items typically include things like confirming a transfer, registering a squad for a competition, or attending critical meetings.
- Treat the Inbox as your action queue: anything shown there is relevant to your role and should be reviewed promptly.

## News and the Social Feed

The Social Feed and News tabs provide layering of commentary, short updates and longer stories from across the footballing world.

- Social Feed: short, timeline-style posts about objects you follow (players, clubs, competitions, journalists). It includes reactions from supporters via the club’s spokesperson to give you a sense of fan sentiment.
- News tab: longer articles and headlines from a wider range of sources. Clicking a story opens it in a pop-out panel so you can read without losing context.

## Following objects and trimming noise

- Follow any object (player, club, competition, journalist) to start receiving social messages and news about it.
- At the start of each season your Personal Assistant will prompt you to review the accounts and topics you follow and suggest additions or removals.
- Use the `Manage` control on the right of the Social Feed to refine followed accounts. The Manage dialog lets you filter by object type and shows a `Followed Accounts` view for fine-grained control.

## Configuring content delivery

- Each followed object exposes two toggles: `Social Content` and `News`. Enable either or both depending on whether you want short feed items, full news stories, or both.
- A frequency setting (Minimal / Normal / Extensive) controls how often social content is generated for that object.
- The pen (edit) icon opens detailed preferences so you can choose specific categories of posts to receive or suppress.
- Individual social messages have a settings icon explaining why you received them and offering a quick path to change that rule.

## Practical tips

- Follow only teams, players and competitions you care about to reduce clutter.
- Review your followed list at season start and after major transfers or board changes.
- Use the `Must Respond` flag as your priority filter: those items should be handled immediately to avoid administrative or competitive penalties.
- Delegate less critical communications to backroom staff using responsibilities if you prefer not to handle every incoming item personally.

If you’d like I can:

- Add this page to the manual index (`docs/manual/README.md`).
- Add screenshots showing how to manage followed accounts and frequency settings.
- Run a markdown spell-check across `docs/manual/` and report findings.
