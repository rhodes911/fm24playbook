# Staff

In this guide:

- Staff Responsibilities
- Staff Attributes
- Coaching Attributes
- Mental Attributes
- Medical Attributes
- Knowledge Attributes
- Data Analysis Attributes
- Non-Player Tendencies
- Staff Roles

The backroom team exists to share the workload and make the club run more smoothly. Use the `Responsibilities` screen to delegate tasks (or keep control) and to review who is assigned to each area of the club. Some roles require specific qualifications, so not every staff member will be available for every responsibility.

## Staff Responsibilities

The `Responsibilities` screen lists every task you currently handle and shows which staff member — if any — you’ve delegated it to. For each responsibility you can pick from a dropdown of eligible staff.

Delegating can save time and reduce micro-management. The effectiveness of a delegated task depends entirely on the attributes of the person you choose: an excellent Assistant Manager or Director of Football can outperform you in that role, while a poor appointment can harm player development, recruitment, or match preparation.

Choose delegation based on the staff member’s strengths and the level of control you want to keep.

## Staff Attributes

Non-player attributes use the same 1–20 scale as player attributes; higher values indicate consistently better performance in that area. Attributes are applied relative to the standard expected at your level and club.

### How attributes affect the club

- A staff member with higher attributes will produce more consistent, higher-quality outcomes (for example: sharper scouting reports, better coaching improvements or more accurate medical assessments).
- The impact of a mid-range attribute depends on context: a physio with a 10 may be above average for a lower league, but below average at the highest level.
- Think in relative terms — good staff at your level are often more valuable than outstanding staff who are mismatched to the job.

## Coaching Attributes

These attributes determine how well a coach trains and influences players in specific technical and tactical areas:

- Attacking — coaching and preference for attacking play; affects training bias and trait development.
- Defending — coaching focus on defensive organisation and preparation.
- Fitness — competence in conditioning and spotting fitness issues.
- Goalkeeper Distribution — coaching a keeper’s distribution decision-making and technique.
- Goalkeeper Handling — coaching on handling, aerials and communication.
- Goalkeeper Shot Stopping — coaching ability for reflexes and one-on-one situations.
- Mental — ability to coach mental aspects and provide effective backroom advice.
- Set Pieces — creating and improving set piece routines.
- Tactical — tactical knowledge and quality of tactical coaching and advice.
- Technical — coaching of ball skills and training session intensity.
- Working With Youngsters — effectiveness working with young players and influence on youth intake quality.

## Mental Attributes

- Adaptability — how well the staff member adapts to living and working in other countries and learning languages.
- Determination — personal drive to improve results and player development.
- Level of Discipline — strictness of approach; affects morale and discipline-related outcomes.
- People Management — skill at managing and organising people, handling morale and coach reports.
- Motivating — effectiveness at motivating players in team talks, meetings and interactions.

## Medical Attributes

- Physiotherapy — quality of physiotherapy provision, injury treatment and player recovery.
- Sports Science — ability to manage fitness levels and reduce injury risk through conditioning programmes.

## Knowledge Attributes

- Judging Player Ability — accuracy when assessing current player quality (important for scouts and coaches).
- Judging Player Potential — accuracy when assessing long-term potential.
- Negotiating — effectiveness in transfer and contract negotiations.

## Data Analysis Attributes

- Analysing Data — the analyst’s ability to interpret statistics and present actionable insights about players or teams.

## Non-Player Tendencies

Tendencies capture a staff member’s behavioural preferences and affect how likely they are to take particular actions. They use the same 1–20 scale but express probability rather than raw competence.

Common tendencies include (examples):

- Operate without an Assistant Manager
- Fit players into a preferred tactic
- Have a large senior squad
- Make early tactical changes
- Rely on set pieces
- Use counter-attacks or a Target Man
- Use younger players in low-priority cups
- Use zonal marking for set pieces
- Sign domestic-based or lower-league players
- Use the loan market or target high-profile signings
- Focus youth signings or spend budget on a single player

These tendencies are useful when predicting how a staff member, manager or board might behave in recruitment, team selection and match preparation.

## Staff Roles

Each backroom staff member can be assigned training duties or other responsibilities. As Manager you can allocate yourself or other staff to most jobs; some roles have constraints:

- First Team Assistant Managers and Coaches generally work with the senior squad only.
- Reserve and youth staff (U21, U19, U18) normally work only with their age groups, unless facilities are shared — in which case assignments can be moved between squads using the shared facilities.
- Fitness Coaches are restricted to Strength and Quickness categories.
- Goalkeeping Coaches focus on Handling and Shot Stopping.

Use these assignments to shape training emphasis, youth development and the day-to-day running of the club.

- Break out each attribute category into its own page for deeper examples and screenshots.
- Produce a quick reference cheat-sheet PDF from the manual pages.
