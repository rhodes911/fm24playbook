# Your Squad, Team Report & Dynamics

This page explains the Squad screens and Data Hub tools you’ll use daily to evaluate players, monitor team performance, manage relationships and guide player development.

## Overview

The Squad Overview gives a snapshot of the first-team: positions, condition, morale, recent form and availability. Filters let you view all contracted players, only the first team, or subsets by position and availability.

Key panels commonly found here:

- Squad list with core details (role, condition, morale, minutes played).
- Matchday and availability indicators for quick selection decisions.
- Shortcuts to player profiles, dynamics and training.

### Squad Planner

The Squad Planner lets you project the squad into the next one or two seasons. It displays contract expiries and estimates how each player would perform in your currently trained roles and tactics.

You can temporarily place players not at your club into formation slots to experiment with how potential signings or hypothetical changes would affect the team. Saved planner setups and Recruitment Focus templates help turn those ideas into formal scouting tasks.

## Report

Backroom staff compile reports to help you understand strengths, weaknesses and individual player summaries.

- Stats: Team and player statistics across many categories; use this to identify over- and under-performing players.
- Comparison: Benchmarks your squad against league peers (by attribute, physical profiles and positional averages).
- Assistant Report: Quick highlights of squad strengths, weaknesses and statistical leaders.
- Experience Matrix: Classifies players as Development, Emerging, Peak or Experienced and shows their importance (Important, Squad Depth, Youth).
- Best XI: A staff-driven suggested starting eleven and best prospects for each position.

## Data Hub (Analytics)

The Data Hub is a customisable analytics workspace offering visualisations, reports and on-demand analyses. It helps turn match and season data into actionable insights.

Overview and tools

- Overview: Composite panels for Team Report, Team Performance (attacking/defending) and Key Findings summarising recent trends.
- Ask For: A keyword-driven request panel to ask analysts for bespoke dataviz; results can be pinned to dashboards.
- Team & Player analytics: Build tailored dashboards for team-wide or player-specific metrics and pin commonly used graphs.
- Matches: ‘Last Match’ and ‘Recent Matches Analysis’ provide summaries, positives/negatives and event visualisations plotted on a pitch.
- Next Opponent: Aggregates scout/analyst intelligence, stat packs and past meetings to prepare tactical plans.

Use Edit Mode to rearrange your analytics panels and create a dashboard tailored to how you like to consume data.

## Dynamics & Player Happiness

Dynamics screens model interpersonal relationships, leadership structures and squad harmony. These insights are essential for keeping morale high and preventing issues from spreading.

Overview

- Match Cohesion: How player relationships are translating into on-field chemistry.
- Dressing Room Atmosphere: The current general feeling in the squad.
- Managerial Support: How much backing you have from the players.

Hierarchy & Social Groups

- Hierarchy: A pyramid view showing team leaders, highly influential players, and other contributors. Keeping leaders content is important since their mood influences the rest of the group.
- Social Groups: Players cluster into social groups; each group can be examined for cohesion or dissent and individual influence.

Happiness metrics

The Squad Happiness panel breaks down areas such as:

- Promises (fulfilment of personal commitments)
- Morale
- Training satisfaction
- Treatment (praise, criticism, fines)
- Feeling about the club and management
- Playing time satisfaction

Overall Happiness summarises these into a single indicator (ranges from Delighted to Devastated) so you can prioritise interventions.

Code of Conduct

Before each season you may set a Code of Conduct defining punishments for transgressions (warnings, fines, suspension levels). You can override individual sanctions later, but the agreed season-wide code cannot be changed until the next season.

Managing unhappy players

- Act early: Inbox prompts, backroom advice and player interactions flag issues before they escalate.
- Team Meetings: Useful for raising morale ahead of important matches.
- Rotation: Selecting happier players can shift dressing-room mood incrementally.
- Remove toxic players: Persistent troublemakers may be best moved on to protect squad cohesion.

## Development

The Development Centre centralises youth progress, loan monitoring and upcoming youth candidates.

Overview

- Loans: See all players out on loan, their game time, performance and satisfaction with the spell.
- Youth squads: Tactical and training details for academy teams including match analysis and development reports.
- Youth Candidates: The annual intake preview showing who may earn professional contracts and what to expect from the crop.

Practical tips

- Use the Experience Matrix to plan who to keep, sell or loan.
- Pin key analytics panels in the Data Hub to monitor metrics important to your tactical approach.
- Keep an eye on social groups and influential players — their mood affects the whole squad.
- Regularly review the Squad Planner when contracts near expiry to avoid last-minute replacements.
