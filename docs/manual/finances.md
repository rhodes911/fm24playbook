# Finances

In this guide:

- Basic Finances
- Financial Fair Play
- Successfully managing your finances

Good financial management is essential. Boards expect it, competitions increasingly enforce rules, and poor decisions can cost points or even your job.

## Basic Finances

Use the Finances screens to monitor the club’s monetary health and to plan ahead:

- Summary — quick snapshot of current status and any compliance flags.
- Income & Expenditure — monthly and seasonal breakdowns of money in and out.
- Wages — analysis of wage spend across squad groups.
- Debt & Loans — outstanding obligations and repayment schedules.
- Sponsors & Other — commercial income streams.
- Projection — a three-season forecast showing likely future positions given current settings.

Check these screens regularly. Some leagues penalise insolvency or administration with points deductions, and creditors can force sales to recoup debts.

## Financial Fair Play (FFP)

Many competitions apply FFP-style rules; where they do, you’ll find the details on the FFP tab and via Inbox updates. The game keeps you informed of the club’s projected compliance and flags possible breaches.

Being aware of the rules that apply to your competitions is essential: non-compliance can lead to heavy sanctions. Use the FFP tools in the finances area to forecast and adjust behaviour before problems occur.

## Successfully managing your finances

Practical steps and reminders:

- Budget adjustments — move funds between transfer and wage budgets via the Club Vision → Budget Adjustment panel, subject to Board approval.
- Understand cashflow — transfer instalments, loyalty payments and agent fees affect cashflow and must be budgeted for.
- Manage wages — renegotiate contracts, defer increases when possible, and watch cumulative wage growth across renewals.
- Use the transfer market wisely — multiple purchases or renewals in a short window can destabilise projections.
- Monitor scouting and youth spend — these are recurring costs that add up across a season.
- Use clauses intelligently — sell-on, buy-back and performance-related payments can protect long-term value but complicate immediate accounting.

If strapped for cash:

- Prioritise wages and essential operating costs.
- Consider selling fringe players or using the loan market to reduce outgoings.
- Renegotiate contracts where reasonable and realistic.

Keep the Board informed and avoid unrealistic requests for funds; they’ll be more likely to support sensible, steady plans than sudden, risky spending.
