# The User Interface

In this guide:

- Control Methods
- Actions & Navigation
- Panels, Tabs and Menus
- Tips & Shortcuts

This page explains the core UI concepts and controls used throughout Football Manager™ 2024 so you can navigate the game confidently.

## Control Methods

- Left Click — primary interaction; click items to open details or activate controls. The cursor changes to indicate clickable elements.
- Right Click — opens a Context Menu with quick actions relevant to the object under the cursor. If nothing appears, no contextual actions are available.

## Actions & Navigation

- Actions can be found on an object’s Tab Bar or via its Context Menu.
- Calendar — open from the Menu Bar to see the current week and upcoming commitments.
- Continue Button — advances game time; its label may change when actions or responses are required.
- Customisable Columns — create and save custom table views via `Views → Customise current view` and rearrange or resize columns.
- Filters — reveal filter controls (usually top-right) to refine lists and reports.

## Panels, Tabs and Menus

- Game Object — the primary entity shown on a screen (player, team, competition).
- Side Bar — club-focused navigation shortcuts; configurable and used to jump between club sections.
- Navigation Bar — browse the wider game world; Back/Forward buttons and Navigation History help retrace steps.
- Tabs — section-specific navigation within a screen (e.g., Overview, Squad, Fixtures).
- Title Bar — screen title, manager name and search field; Search provides quick links and auto-complete.
- Quick Flicks — arrows in the title bar to jump between similar objects (players, squads, etc.).
- World Popup — access nation/competition/team hierarchies and Bookmarks for quick navigation.

## Tables, Views & Tooltips

- View Menus allow switching between pre-defined table layouts depending on the information you need.
- Tooltips explain UI items: hover to reveal helpful descriptions.

## Shortcuts & Display Modes

- Shortcuts — many keyboard shortcuts exist and can be customised in Preferences → Shortcuts.
- Windowed / Fullscreen — display modes and resolution options live in Preferences → Interface.

## Quick Tips

- Use the Back/Forward menu to jump to screens you recently visited.
- Create Bookmarks for frequently-used screens via the World popup.
- Resize and reorder columns to surface the data you need most.
