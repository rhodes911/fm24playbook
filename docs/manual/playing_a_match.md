This page walks through the matchday flow: preparing, selecting a team, communicating with players, and managing the game from the touchline.

## Pre-Match Staff Meeting

The final tactical and analytical briefing comes from your backroom team. They supply an opposition report, expected line-up, tactical pointers and any last-minute notes that may affect selection or approach.

Use these insights to confirm your game plan and to spot threats or opportunities to exploit.

## Team Selection

Matchday is your final chance to pick a squad. Run through a checklist before confirming your selection:

- Are players suited to their Roles and Duties in the chosen tactic?
- Are they match-fit and sufficiently sharp?
- Who’s in form and who’s not?
- Do you have tactical flexibility if the plan doesn’t work?
- Can your substitutes change the game if needed?
- What is the team morale and are there high-morale players not involved?
- Does the fixture schedule require rotation or resting key players?
- Any promised playing time or unhappy players to consider?
- Have you prepared plans to counter the opposition’s main threats?
- How important is the match relative to board expectations?

Answering these helps you avoid last-minute surprises and improves the chance of a positive result.

## Pre-Match Briefing

After selection your players give instant feedback. Note positive and negative reactions — confident players tend to perform better, while disgruntled players may struggle.

The Team Sheet, staff advice and social media reaction (via the Press Officer) give a final snapshot before kick-off. If you handle pre-match media duties, you’ll get a short tunnel interview before the game.

## Team Talks

Team talks are powerful levers to influence your squad before kick-off, at half-time and after the final whistle. Use them thoughtfully.

Tones available include: Aggressive, Assertive, Cautious, Reluctant, Calm, Passionate.

High-level sentiments are: Angry, Disappointed, Encourage, Sympathise, Pleased, Delighted.

Combine tone and sentiment to craft a message appropriate to the situation and the personalities involved. Consider:

- Recent form and expectations
- Opposition strength
- Player morale and body language
- Importance of the match
- Performance in the first half (for halftime talks)
- Fixture congestion and subsequent matches

Remember: a talk that motivates some players may demotivate others. Use assistant advice and player profiles to pick the right approach.

## The Match Screen

The match screen centres on the pitch and presents tools for in-game management.

Pitch — main 3D or highlights view showing the action; scoreboard and match settings are at the top.

Tactics — quick access to shape, style, mentality and instructions; `Full Tactics` opens the full tactics editor.

Players — your on-pitch XI is shown; select any player to change position, role, instructions, or shout to them directly.

Dugout — request information or analysis from staff via `Show Me` (analytics, opposition info) or `Ask For` (assistant advice).

Settings — control match speed, replays, highlight saturation and camera views. Use the Touchline Tablet icon to enable/disable extra overlays and widgets.

In Between Highlights — in condensed modes, staff advice and key updates appear between clips to keep you informed.

## Managing During the Match

Watch the match and decide whether to:

a) keep the current plan (it’s working),
b) change tactic because the opposition are nullifying you, or
c) exploit an opportunity exposed by the opponent.

Examples of responses:

- Change roles (e.g., Inside Forward → Winger) to attack different areas.
- Adjust playing style (more patient vs more direct) to bypass a packed midfield.
- Rotate personnel to preserve energy across congested schedules.

Shouts

Touchline shouts are short emotionally-charged prompts sent to the team or individuals. Common effects:

- Encourage/Praise — lift motivation if successful, can frustrate if ignored.
- Berate/Fire Up/Focus/Demand More — increase intensity and focus if they land, risk demotivation if poorly timed.
- Calm Down/No Pressure — reduce tension but may add pressure for some players.

Success depends on morale, body language and player personalities. Check player states before using shouts.

## Full-Time

At full-time receive a roundup of wider results and media reaction from the Press Officer. Complete any post-match media obligations and use the full-time talk to shape the players’ post-match mindset.
