# Players

This page explains the Squad screens and player-centric features you’ll use most often: status flags and info pop-ups, playing-time roles, positional competence, attributes, traits, medical tools, development workflows and interaction options.

## Overview & Status Flags

Every person in lists (players and staff) exposes a small avatar or silhouette that opens an Information pop-up. Use this to get quick biographical facts, primary attributes and common actions without opening the full player profile. Right-clicking a name also exposes the quick Actions menu for fast tasks.

Players may display one or more status flags on squad lists and player cards (injury, loan, transfer listed, unavailable, etc.). Hover (or long-press on touch) to show the tooltip and then visit the player’s Overview screen for full context and guidance.

## Playing Time

Playing Time replaces the older Squad Status concept to give clearer expectations about a player’s role and the minutes they’ll expect. Assigning and managing these tiers is central to morale and rotation planning.

Common Playing Time tiers

- Star Player — a top team figure who expects regular starts and senior wages.
- Important Player — regular starters who drive the team when Stars are absent.
- Regular Starter — normally selected most weeks.
- Squad Player — rotation option who fills in across the season.
- Impact Sub — a substitute expected to change games when introduced.
- Fringe Player — occasional first-team opportunities.
- B Team Regular — for clubs with a B side; a senior who plays there regularly.
- Breakthrough Prospect/Hot Prospect/Youngster — graduated labels for young players at different stages toward the first team.
- Surplus to Requirements — players no longer required by the manager.

Goalkeeper-specific roles such as First-Choice, Backup, Cup Goalkeeper or Emergency Backup provide similar expectations for custodians.

Distributing playing-time roles thoughtfully reduces discontent and helps long-term development.

## Positions

The Positions panel shows where a player can operate on the pitch and the competence level for each location. The graphic is colour-coded and lists a player’s natural position as well as secondary positions.

Competence levels (approximate mapping to internal scale):

- Natural: elite fit for the role
- Accomplished: strong and reliable
- Competent: solid, regular performer
- Unconvincing: adequate short-term
- Awkward: struggles outside preferred roles
- Ineffectual/Makeshift: unsuitable except as emergency cover

The panel also reports games played in each position and a player’s comfort with either foot. Playing someone out of position can work short-term; long-term success depends on attribute fit and training.

## An Introduction to Attributes

Attributes are numeric ratings (1–20) that define what a player is good at. They’re grouped into Technical, Mental and Physical areas; goalkeepers have a specialised set of goalkeeping attributes. Some attributes are relatively fixed (innate traits like Determination), while many are trainable and develop with game time, coaching and facilities.

Unscouted players appear with attribute ranges; more scouting narrows these ranges to exact values. Different attributes carry different weightings for each position and role — the player role helper highlights which attributes matter most.

Small attribute differences matter: a one-point gap can change consistency of actions (passes, tackles, decisions) and compound over a season into meaningful advantage.

### How attributes interact

Attributes combine to form player types (athletic, creative, defensive) and work together with situational factors (opposition pressure, pitch condition, tactics). Use role previews and Key Attributes overlays to see what matters for a specific role.

## Technical Attributes (selected)

- Corners, Crossing — delivery from set and wide positions.
- Dribbling, First Touch, Technique — ball control and manipulation.
- Finishing, Penalty Taking, Long Shots — goal-scoring ability.
- Passing, Vision — distribution, both short and long.
- Marking, Tackling — defensive skillset.
- Heading, Long Throws — aerial and set-piece utility.

(Technical attributes affect execution quality and work alongside physical and mental traits.)

## Mental Attributes (selected)

- Aggression — competitive edge and intensity.
- Anticipation, Off the Ball, Positioning — reading the game and movement.
- Bravery, Determination, Composure — temperament under pressure.
- Concentration, Decisions — consistency and quality of choices.
- Leadership, Teamwork, Work Rate — influence on others and buy‑in to tactics.
- Vision, Flair — creativity and spotting opportunities.

## Physical Attributes (selected)

- Acceleration, Pace — short burst speed and top speed.
- Agility, Balance — movement and stability.
- Stamina, Natural Fitness — endurance and recovery.
- Strength, Jumping Reach — physical duels and aerial presence.

## Goalkeeping Attributes (selected)

- Aerial Reach, Command of Area, Communication — dominance and organisation.
- Handling, Reflexes, One-on-Ones — shotstopping and security.
- Kicking, Throwing — distribution from the back.
- Rushing Out, Punching (tendencies), Eccentricity — behavioural tendencies that shape decisions.

Some outfield technical attributes (First Touch, Passing) also apply to goalkeepers to shape their playing style.

## Attribute Changes

Use the Attribute Changes screen to track development and regression over time. Select attributes and a timeframe to view line graphs and exact numeric deltas. The summary shows Technical, Mental and Physical trends across the chosen span.

## Player Traits

Player Traits (sometimes called PPMs) influence repetitive on-pitch decisions and tendencies. Traits can be learned, reinforced or lost and interact with attributes and tactical instructions.

Examples of common traits (paraphrased):

- Runs With Ball Down Left/Right/Centre, Cuts Inside, Hugs Line — preferred movement patterns.
- Gets Into Opposition Area, Makes Runs In Behind, Comes Deep To Get Ball — attacking timing and positioning.
- Plays Short Simple Passes, Tries Killer Balls, Plays One-Twos — passing choices and creativity.
- Shoots From Distance, Shoots With Power, Places Shots — shooting preferences.
- Marks Opponent Tightly, Brings Ball Out of Defence — defensive tendencies.
- Avoids Using Weaker Foot, Develops Weaker Foot — foot preference and training focus.
- Tries Tricks, Likes To Lob Keeper, Likes To Round Keeper — flair and finishing style.
- Dwells On Ball, Stops Play — slower decision tendencies.
- Various goalkeeper-only traits (Uses Long Throw To Start Counter Attacks, Plays Ball With Feet).

Traits shape repeat behaviour and should be considered when recruiting or assigning roles.

## Medical Centre

The Medical Centre centralises injury prevention, risk assessment and rehabilitation tracking.

- Overview shows players at risk, workload summaries and staff assessments.
- Risk Assessment lets you review squad-wide injury proneness in the context of upcoming fixtures and training load.
- Current Injuries and Injury History provide individual timelines and comparisons against league and historical club figures.
- Season Summary aggregates time lost and matches missed per player.

Use medical advice, adjust training load and rotation to reduce injury risk — prevention is cheaper than rehabilitation.

## Development

The player development tools let you configure training, monitor attribute progress and plan loans or squad moves.

- Individual training and tactical familiarity increase attributes and role understanding over time.
- The Tactical Familiarity overlay shows how comfortable a player is in your system (Awkward → Competent → Accomplished → Fluid).
- Loans are tracked in a Loans panel showing game time, performance and player satisfaction.
- Youth Candidates appear during intake windows with summaries to help decide who to offer contracts to.

Ways to accelerate development

- Better coaches and higher-quality staff.
- Superior training facilities and improved training schedules.
- Regular meaningful playing time (first-team minutes matter most).
- Mentoring from experienced teammates influences mental attributes and traits.

## Interaction

Interact with players via the Interaction tab and Actions menu to praise, criticise, set targets, offer new contracts, discipline or move them between squads.

- Set season targets for loaned or unhappy players (goals, assists, clean sheets) to give clarity and measurable expectations.
- Discipline (warnings/fines) should be used sparingly and only with cause — overuse damages relationships and reputation.
- Use the Comparison and Find Similar tools to evaluate players against each other or locate transfer targets with similar profiles.

## Contracts & Transfers (brief)

From the player screen you can start contract talks, discuss new deals with agents, hand negotiations to your Director of Football, add players to the Unwanted List or offer them via the Transfer Room. Mutual terminations and releases are also available but carry financial and relationship consequences.
