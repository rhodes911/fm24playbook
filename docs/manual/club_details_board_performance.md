# Club Details & Board Performance

In this guide:

- Profile
- Affiliates
- Board and Supporter Confidence

This page summarises the Club Profile screens, how facilities and affiliates work, and how Board and fan confidence is measured and influenced.

## Profile

The Club Profile gives a quick overview of the club: basic details, league history, employees, recent results, kits, stadium and other club information. The same layout applies for national teams.

### General

The General view expands on core details and highlights Legends, Icons and Favoured Personnel associated with the club.

### News

The News section aggregates major club-related items — transfers, board decisions, and broader club commentary.

### Facilities

Facilities matter for player development and club progression. Key facility groups include the Training Ground, Youth Facilities and Data Analysis Facilities. Each is graded on a 10-point descriptive scale:

- State of the Art, Excellent, Superb, Great, Good, Average, Adequate, Below Average, Basic, Poor

Stadium and Pitch Conditions use a seven-level scale:

- Perfect, Very Good, Good, OK, Poor, Very Poor, Terrible

Corporate facilities are graded on seven steps:

- Top, Good, Average, Adequate, Fairly Basic, Basic, None

Junior Coaching and Youth Recruitment use a nine-level scale:

- Exceptional, Excellent, Good, Adequate, Average, Fairly Basic, Basic, Limited, None

There are five Youth Level audit grades (1 highest, 4 lowest, 0 = no audited status). Improving facilities increases player development rates, improves coaching effectiveness and raises the quality of youth intakes. Costs for upgrades rise steeply at higher tiers and depend on the country’s financial context.

If industry standards evolve faster than your upgrades, you may receive Inbox notices that your facilities have been downgraded relative to the new norm even if nothing physically changed.

## Affiliates

Affiliations are formal links with other clubs that can provide loans, facility sharing, scouting advantages, commercial benefits or youth development opportunities. Affiliations can be local, national or international and each type has specific benefits:

- Loan partnerships — senior clubs make players available on loan to the affiliate, often at no cost.
- Facility-sharing — affiliates may share training facilities to benefit a lower-level partner.
- National/international player loans — player exchanges across borders to aid development or to navigate work permit rules.
- Commercial links — partnerships that provide financial benefits and access to new markets.
- Youth development links — shared youth intake benefits and talent pipelines.
- First-option or matching rights — a senior affiliate can match accepted transfer offers for players at the lower affiliate.
- Shared youth/reserve arrangements — cooperative youth systems for mutual benefit.

Proposed affiliates appear under a ‘Proposed Affiliates’ panel and the Board can be requested to look for senior affiliates on your behalf. Affiliations may be cancelled if the lower club is promoted into the same division, underused (few or no loans), or if reputational changes make the arrangement untenable.

## Board and Supporter Confidence

Board and fan confidence are central to job security and club direction. The Club Vision and Confidence panels show the Board’s and supporters’ expectations and satisfaction across categories such as Club Vision alignment, Match performance, Transfers, Tactics and Squad Management.

The Club Vision screen also displays supporter composition (Hardcore, Core, Family, Fair Weather, Corporate, Casual) as a pie chart and provides insight into social metrics like follower counts.

### What affects confidence?

- Results and on-field performance
- Progress towards the Club Vision
- Transfer activity and squad planning
- Tactical coherence and squad management
- Financial stability and sensible Board requests
- Handling of player concerns and dressing-room dynamics

### Keeping the Board happy

Key guidelines to maintain Board confidence:

- Keep promises in job negotiations and to the Club Vision.
- Monitor Dynamics and respond to emerging issues quickly.
- Address player concerns before they escalate.
- Deliver reasonable on-field results while meeting short- and long-term objectives.
- Maintain sound financial control and avoid overreaching demands.
- Understand your status before requesting major resources.

### Performance ratings and job security

Manager performance is expressed via a grading scale (A+ best → downwards). These map conceptually to job-security levels and are visible on the Job Security screen.

Common performance states:

- Untouchable — highest confidence; job is very secure.
- Very Secure — strong support and margin for error.
- Secure — solid performance with no immediate concerns.
- Stable — around midpoint, trending is important.
- Insecure — performance below expectations; risk of action.
- Very Insecure — imminent danger; results necessary.
- Precarious — close to dismissal; urgent improvement required.
- Under Review — used after board takeovers while the new Chair assesses the role.

Maintaining good standing requires regular attention across all the areas the Board and fans evaluate — treat confidence as an ongoing KPI.
