# Training

In this guide:

- Overview
- Sessions
- Schedules
- Units
- Mentoring
- Individual training
- Coaches

This page summarises the training system and the options available when building schedules and sessions for your squad.

## Overview

Training is organised around the in-game week and is shaped by the number of fixtures. In a typical single-match week you’ll usually see two scheduled sessions per day plus a possible Extra session depending on intensity and workload.

You can choose how involved to be:

- Fully delegate to your backroom staff using preset schedules.
- Pick and tweak a preset schedule.
- Fully customise each Unit, Session and weekly Schedule yourself.

You may switch between delegation and hands-on control at any time. New managers often start with staff-run schedules and gradually take control as they learn.

Up to three tactics can be trained simultaneously. The Primary Tactic receives 60% of Tactical Familiarity contribution, while the other two receive 20% each. Familiarity grows depending on repeated instructions and role exposure across the tactics and is tracked per-player.

Be mindful of workload and player satisfaction — excessive or poorly-targeted training can lead to unhappiness and burnout.

### Basics

- Training is planned with weekly Schedules.
- Schedules contain Sessions (Session 1, Session 2 and Extra).
- Sessions contain exercises and are grouped into categories.

## Sessions

Selecting a Session shows the available options for that slot. Sessions are grouped into categories such as General, Match Preparation, Attacking, Defending, Technical, Tactical, Goalkeeping, Set Pieces, Physical and Extra-Curricular.

Many Sessions split the squad into three Units: Offensive, Defensive and Goalkeeping. One Unit will usually be the Primary Focus (60% of the work), with the others taking Secondary Focus. Some sessions are whole-team activities; goalkeepers typically always handle goalkeeper-specific work.

Examples: an Attacking Session emphasises chance creation for the Offensive Unit; the Defensive Unit works on preventing those patterns while Goalkeepers focus on preventing goals.

## Schedules

Schedules are your weekly plan. Pay attention to Intensity indicators when building or editing a Schedule to avoid overloading players and increasing injury risk. Schedules show how each day benefits Defensive, Offensive and Goalkeeping Units.

Extra Sessions are useful if you have spare days but increase fatigue quickly — they’re more suited to youth teams where additional learning time is often beneficial.

Use `Select Schedule` to pick a pre-built schedule (Pre-Season, Mid-Season, Late-Season templates) and then tweak as needed. Professional clubs have the full week available; semi-professional and amateur clubs have fewer days to use.

## Units

Units split the squad into groups for session work (Offensive, Defensive and Goalkeeping). You choose who is assigned to each Unit and which role they perform in training; assignments are universal across sessions (players won’t be in different Units for different sessions). Youth and reserve players may be invited into Units to accelerate development.

## Mentoring

Mentoring (formerly Tutoring) groups younger players with experienced teammates to pass on behavioural and professional attributes. A mentoring group needs at least three players. Success depends on the senior player’s profile, the chemistry between participants and sustained exposure — benefits plateau over time.

## Individual training

Individual training lets you target a player’s position, role or specific attributes and is carried out in sessions automatically by appropriate Units. Individual training areas include:

- Injury Rehabilitation (Quickness, Agility & Balance, Strength, Endurance, General Rehab).
- Set Pieces (Free Kicks, Corners, Penalties, Long Throws).
- Specific Attributes (Quickness, Agility & Balance, Strength, Endurance, Defensive Positioning, Attacking Movement, Final Third, Shooting, Passing, Crossing, Ball Control, Aerial).
- Goalkeeping (Reactions, Tactical, Technique, Sweeping, Distribution).

Intensity for individual work can be Normal, Half or Double which adjusts the player’s workload accordingly.

### Rest

Players can be given scheduled rest from pitch and gym for short periods (one day up to two weeks). Rest can boost morale and aid recovery but should be used judiciously to avoid under-training.

## Coaches

The `Coaches` tab controls how backroom staff run training. Most coaches can work across many categories unless they’re a specialist (goalkeeping, fitness) or restricted by their assignment (youth/reserve).

Coaching proficiency is shown as a star rating (1–5 stars). Assign coaches to areas where they’re strongest to improve training effectiveness — a high-attribute coach focused on their strengths yields better results.

You can also assign yourself to specific coaching areas, leveraging the attributes you selected when creating your manager profile.

## Best practice for beginners

- Run a structured pre-season to build physical conditioning and reduce early-season fatigue.
- Use template Schedules to start and tweak gradually.
- Include a Match Preview session before fixtures for opponent analysis and a Recovery session after games.
- Reserve the Extra slot for weeks with fewer matches; rest is as important as training.

If you’d like I can:

- Add this page to the manual index (`docs/manual/README.md`).
- Split the page into separate deep-dive pages (e.g., `set_pieces.md`, `individual_training.md`) and add cross-links.
- Generate a printable quick-reference sheet from these pages (requires a local PDF tool such as Pandoc or wkhtmltopdf).
