# Football Glossary

This glossary explains common football terms and phrases you may encounter while playing. It isn't exhaustive but covers the entries most frequently used in-game and in football reporting.

Away Goals rule
A tiebreaker used in some two-legged fixtures where the team that scored more goals away from home wins if the aggregate score is level.
