# Quick Start Guide — Introduction

This page gives new managers a gentle introduction to the game, points you to built-in tutorials, and explains the Inbox and core navigation so you can get up and running quickly.

## Beginner’s Guide

If you’re new to football or to Football Manager, start here. Create a manager profile and begin a Career save — the profile stores your identity, preferences and appearance so you can reuse it across saves.

Time in the game advances when you press the Continue button. The simulation runs while time progresses and pauses afterwards so you can review messages, set up tactics, make transfers and handle other duties at your own pace.

Your first step is usually to set up a manager profile and start a new Career — use the Quick Start options for sensible defaults, or the Advanced Setup if you prefer to customise nations, leagues and database depth.

## Tutorials

The game includes a series of interactive tutorials that appear during your first days and weeks in a new Career. They are delivered by your Assistant Manager (or another club staff member when an Assistant is not present) and cover common tasks such as scouting, offering transfers, getting to know your squad and preparing for your first match.

These guides are sent automatically if you indicated you are a beginner when creating your profile; if you declared yourself experienced they are still available from the help (?) icon in the title bar.

## Your Inbox — central hub for decisions

The Inbox is the main place you’ll receive important messages and prompts. Much of the gameplay revolves around responding to items that arrive here: offers, reports, meeting requests and other events that need your attention.

When the game needs your input, it pauses and returns you to the Inbox so you can act. Treat it as your home base for day-to-day management.

## Explore and interact

Move your cursor around screens to reveal clickable people, clubs and other entities. Hovering and clicking is a quick way to learn what each screen contains and which actions are available.

Spend some time exploring the Side Bar on the left — it provides fast access to squad, tactics, staff, training, scouting, and other key areas. Many screens also include a horizontal tab bar beneath the main menu and a search box for quick navigation.

After reading the first Inbox messages, pick a tactic and select your starting lineup — the Tactics tutorial is useful here and will guide you through choosing a style, formation and initial XI.

## Help and delegation

If you prefer, you can delegate tasks to your backroom staff. The Responsibilities section in the Staff area lets you assign duties like scouting, press handling and match-day team talks to trusted staff members.

Delegating can reduce the workload while you learn, and you can gradually take responsibilities back as you become more confident.

## Keep players happy

Player morale and individual happiness are critical. Monitor each player’s information screen and respond to concerns promptly — how you handle player issues has a direct effect on squad morale and on-field results.

Happiness is also influenced by options you chose in your manager profile (such as discipline settings) and by your ongoing management choices.

## Be patient

FM is deep and there’s a learning curve. Take your time, use the manual and tutorials as companions, and enjoy building your career. Small, steady improvements to your team and tactics will usually pay off more reliably than attempting risky shortcuts.

If you want I can:

- Add or update links in the manual index (`docs/manual/README.md`).
- Split sections into separate pages (for example: Tutorials, Inbox & Navigation).
- Run a quick markdown spell-check across `docs/manual/` and report any issues.
