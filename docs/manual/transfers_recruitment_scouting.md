This page summarises how to identify targets, manage scouting resources, and complete transfer and loan business.

## Scouting Centre

The Scouting Centre is the hub for identifying and tracking talent. Use the top bar to access core features: set the club’s Recruitment Focus, delegate Scouting Responsibility to staff, review your Recruitment Team and manage Scouting Budget and Transfer/Wage budgets.

Key panel — Recommendations: scout/agent/player recommendations arrive as cards or a list. Common actions:

- Not Interested — dismiss a recommendation.
- Acknowledge — keep as a candidate in the Scouting Centre.
- Fully Scout Player — assign a scout for a full report.
- Make Offer — begin transfer negotiations.
- Add to Shortlist — monitor and receive updates.

Use Recommendations to triage quickly and send high-priority players into assignments or offers.

## Player Search

Use `New Search` to build filters (Quick or Advanced) and find players that match your tactical and budgetary needs. Quick Search presets are available for common roles.

Search results show essential details and the Scout Recommendation grade (A–E with +/-) which summarises scout confidence. Deep dive into individual reports and match footage for the clearest picture.

## Recruitment Focus & Assignments

Recruitment Focus defines the parameters scouts and analysts use when searching — position, age, physical profile, tactical fit and more. Assignments list active scouting tasks and priorities; if work queues up because of limited staff, review the Priorities queue and reassign or clear lower-priority requests.

Scouting Coverage (World, Continental, Regional, National, Surrounding Division, Divisional) controls how wide your immediate scouting range is and impacts monthly cost. Wider ranges increase the pool of players you can discover but cost more to run.

World Knowledge aggregates the club’s scouting know-how across staff and affiliates and helps you decide where to send scouts to maximise effectiveness.

## Agents

Agents are more active and influential. Build relationships with those who represent players at your club — they can help resolve player unhappiness, provide market information and assist in moves. You can also hire intermediary agents to facilitate transfers and loan negotiations.

## Shortlist

Use the Shortlist to monitor targets you can’t sign immediately. Shortlisted players generate news updates and can be filtered and compared to players in your squad. Scouting or Analyst reports can be requested directly from the Shortlist.

Shortlists are savable and loadable — useful for different transfer strategies or windows.

## Reports and Feedback

Scout Reports present strengths/weaknesses, fit to your tactics and incremental knowledge as more matches are watched. Typically three to four full match viewings are required for a near-complete report. Use the knowledge tracker to monitor progress and gaps in understanding.

Deeper scouting reduces the risk of signing an unsuitable player but costs time and money — weigh urgency against the need for certainty.

## Making a Transfer Offer

The Transfer Offer screen lets you compose a detailed proposal: fee, payment schedule, transfer date (Immediate or delayed), additional clauses and part-exchange players. Use the padlock to mark terms as non-negotiable or semi-negotiable.

Consider using `Suggest Terms` for live negotiation when you want a faster resolution. Assistant advice appears in the comments panel and can suggest clubs that may be interested in a part-exchange.

## Making a Loan Offer

Loans are flexible: set duration, wage contribution, fees and clauses (including future fees or permanent options). You can offer playing/non-playing monthly fees to incentivise a parent club.

Declare the intended squad role for the loanee to make the proposal clearer and to reassure the parent club about playing time.

## Free Agents

Free agents are a valuable pool for cash-strapped clubs. Use the free agent market to find experienced or specialist players, particularly in lower leagues where contract churn is higher.

## Selling and Loaning Players Out

Initiate sales via `Offer to Clubs` or let your Director of Football handle departures by adding players to the Unwanted List. When selling, consider clauses (sell-on, buy-back) to preserve future value.

For loans, configure conditions such as whether the player can play against you, cup-tied rules, and whether the loan is terminable early. Make sure the borrowing club will play the player in the desired position to benefit development.

## Transfer Deadline Day

Deadline Day is fast and dramatic. Opt into the themed Deadline Day experience to receive a dedicated feed, agent tips and Director of Football suggestions. Expect last-minute bids, rumours and media attention as clubs push to complete late deals.
