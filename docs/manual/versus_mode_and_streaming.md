# Versus Mode & Streaming

This short guide explains the Versus Mode feature and basic streaming guidance so you can share your Football Manager™ 2024 experience.

## Versus Mode

Versus Mode lets you pit teams you’ve developed against other managers online. It’s aimed at competitive and community play and requires an FMFC account to participate. Use the in-game Versus options to select a team you’ve built and challenge opponents or accept challenges from other managers.

Versus Mode workflows and rules are presented in-game; make sure to review matchmaking requirements and any platform-specific guidance before committing to competitive matches.

## Streaming basics

Streaming your playthrough is straightforward once you have a streaming account and software configured. The high-level steps:

1. Create an account on your chosen streaming platform and read their broadcasting guidelines.
2. Install streaming software (examples include OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS, or the platform’s recommended client).
3. Add Football Manager as a source (game capture, window capture or monitor capture) in your streaming software.
4. Configure audio, overlays and moderation tools as desired.
5. Start streaming and interact with your viewers.

## Best practices

- Test your stream privately before going live to check audio levels and overlays.
- Use a dedicated scene for match highlights to manage what you show viewers (protect player privacy if needed).
- Engage with your audience via chat but prioritise watching the match so you don’t miss key tactical moments.
- Consider showing tactical screens, training setups or post-match analysis segments to add value for viewers.
