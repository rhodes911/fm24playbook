### Past Positions & Rules

Past Positions plots a team’s round-by-round progress. The Rules screen contains all competition-specific regulations — read these early to ensure squad compliance.

### Structure & Stadiums

Structure explains promotion/relegation and the competition’s format. The Stadiums screen ranks venues by capacity and lists pitch details.

### Sponsorship & Scouting Options

### Referees, Injuries & Suspensions

Monitor referee tendencies (cards and penalties), an injury table showing squads’ current absentees and a suspensions list to plan selections accordingly.

## Transfers

Track all completed transfers involving competition clubs, manager movements and transfer window summaries. For leagues with drafts (e.g., MLS), the Draft screen displays pick orders and prospects.

## Awards & History

Awards lists seasonal honours and winners. The History screen records competition records and past data — useful for context and attainable milestones.

## Juggling the Fixture List

Fixture congestion is inevitable across long seasons. Use the Schedule and Fixtures screens to forecast congestion and prepare rotations:

- Plan squads several matches ahead to keep key players fresh for priority fixtures.
- Use rotation and rest (particularly after dense runs) to reduce injury risk.
- Prioritise competitions when depth is limited and adjust Match Plans accordingly.

Proactive planning pays off: set Match Preview sessions before fixtures for opponent analysis and consider saving a lighter schedule in weeks with multiple matches.

If you’d like I can:

- Add this page to the manual index (`docs/manual/README.md`) and create a sidebar navigation for the manual pages.
- Produce a printable fixtures planning checklist to help manage congestion.

## League Information — selected examples

Some national leagues use rules and formats that are less familiar to new players. Below are concise overviews of a few competitions that have more complex structures and eligibility rules.

### Australia (A-League)

Competition structure
- Twelve teams play each other three times across a season (33 matches), typically running from October to April.
- The top six enter a Finals Series: 1–2 receive byes; 3–6 contest knock-out ties leading to semi-finals and a Grand Final. The Grand Final winner and the regular-season (premiership) winner qualify for continental competition — if one team wins both, the Grand Final runner-up takes the second continental spot. Wellington Phoenix are ineligible for Asian competition because they are based in New Zealand (Oceania).

Squad and eligibility highlights
- Squads are limited (26 players maximum, 20 minimum) and must include two goalkeepers.
- Foreign player quotas typically permit up to five overseas players; at least three Australian (or NZ for Phoenix) U23 players must be registered.
- A salary cap is enforced (roughly A$2.6m at the game’s start) with a minimum spend requirement. Designated Player rules allow two players to be exempt from the cap. Guest and Mature-Age Rookie provisions permit short-term or non-standard registrations under specific limits.
- Matchday squads allow up to seven substitutes (maximum three used), with minimum numbers of domestic U22/U23 players required on the bench and in the match-day selection.

Transfer market notes
- The salary cap and league reputation mean international transfers are often focused on Designated Player slots; clubs commonly prioritise developing local talent and intra-league movement is restricted.
- The main transfer window runs in the off-season (roughly July–October) with a shorter mid-season window in January.

### Belgium (Pro League)

Competition structure
- Eighteen teams play a 34-game regular season (home and away). Post-season playoffs follow for many teams.
- The Championship Group (top four) halves points carried over from the regular season and plays six additional fixtures (home and away) to decide the champion and European qualification slots. Teams placed 5–8 enter a separate playoff pathway, with the winner contesting for a Europa Conference place against the Championship Group’s fourth-placed side.
- Recent format changes have seen three teams relegated directly from the regular season.

Squad and eligibility highlights
- Clubs must include a set number of locally trained players in their overall squads and matchday selections (for example, several players trained in Belgium before their 23rd birthday). Check the Rules sub-tab for exact figures per season.

Transfer market notes
- Belgian clubs operate a conventional European transfer market model and often combine youth development with scouting of South America, Eastern Europe and Africa to find value.

### United States (MLS)

Competition structure
- MLS is split into Eastern and Western conferences (geographic split). Teams play a 34-match regular season with an unbalanced schedule (more games against conference rivals).
- Playoffs determine conference champions with seeded single-leg knockout rounds; conference winners meet in the MLS Cup Final, hosted by the team with the better regular-season record.
- Continental qualification involves MLS Cup finalists, Supporters’ Shield winners (most regular-season points) and the US Open Cup winner; overlapping slots pass down the league table.

Squad and eligibility highlights
- Rosters may contain up to 30 players with complex classifications: Designated Players (up to three), international slots (tradable), Off-Budget and Reserve designations, Generation Adidas exemptions and more.
- MLS uses a salary cap (the rules and figures change season-to-season); certain players (Designated Players, Generation Adidas) have special salary cap treatments and clubs use Allocation Money (GAM/TAM) to buy down cap charges.

Transfer market notes
- MLS mixes traditional transfers with a large number of league-specific mechanisms (trades, allocation funds, draft picks). The SuperDraft and intra-league trading are major features of player movement, alongside international signings into designated roles.
- Domestic transfer periods in MLS are mostly open year-round with a short break; specific windows for international transfers vary and are enforced per calendar year.

For precise regulations (squad limits, salary figures and registration cut-offs) use the competition’s Rules sub-tab in-game — those values can change between seasons and patches.
